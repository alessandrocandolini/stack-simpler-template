# stack-simpler-template

Simpler template for stack projects, based on the [new-template](https://github.com/commercialhaskell/stack-templates/blob/master/new-template.hsfiles) but two major differences:
* removing things that are not relevant for projects that are not intended to be published on hackage, 
* and with few opinionated dependencies and GHC extensions already imported (for testing, etc)
